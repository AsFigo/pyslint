**Describe the bug/issue**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Specifically if you disagree with a PySlint Violation, mention the specific RULE_ID (e.g. I expected the rule NAME_AST_PREFIX not to fire on this assertion as the label is correct). 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. python3 ../py_src/pyslint.py -t ../sv_tests/my_issue.sv

Add sample log below

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Either you did NOT expect this Violation or you expected a Violation to be flagged, but unfortunately, PySlint did not flag it.
 

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
