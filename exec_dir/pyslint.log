PySlint: Violation: [PERF_CG_NO_ABIN_W_DEF_CL]: Found Array-bins: 
	covergroup: cg_with_arr_def
	coverpoint: i
	BIN: others
	bins others[] = default;

	While IEEE 1800 LRM allows this syntax, this is bad for Performance aspect as it ends up creating large number of bins. Recommended to remove this bin.
PySlint: Violation: [REUSE_CG_NO_ILBINS_CL]: Found 'illegal_bins' under user-defined bins: 
covergroup: cg_o_sig for coverpoint: cpt_osig : o_sig_8b invalid_vals
While IEEE 1800 LRM allows this syntax, this is bad for REUSE aspect as it does not flag as UVM_ERROR or $error. 
Also if coverage is turned OFF, this error is likely to go unflagged. Recommended to use 'ignore_bins' instead 
from coverage perspective and add SVA or scoreboard for illegal values.
PySlint: Violation: [COMPAT_CG_OPT_PI_CL]: Found 'type_option.per_instance' inside a covergroup: cg_o_sig
IEEE 1800 LRM does not allow such usage though some tools do compile. 
To avoid compatibility issues, please move the per_instance to 'option.per_instance '
